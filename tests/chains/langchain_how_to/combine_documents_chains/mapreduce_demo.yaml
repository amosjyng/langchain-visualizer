      of the text is relevant to answer the question. \nReturn any relevant text verbatim.\nTonight.
      I call on the Senate to: Pass the Freedom to Vote Act. Pass the John Lewis Voting
      Rights Act. And while you\u2019re at it, pass the Disclose Act so Americans
      can know who is funding our elections. \n\nTonight, I\u2019d like to honor someone
      who has dedicated his life to serve this country: Justice Stephen Breyer\u2014an
      Army veteran, Constitutional scholar, and retiring Justice of the United States
      Supreme Court. Justice Breyer, thank you for your service. \n\nOne of the most
      serious constitutional responsibilities a President has is nominating someone
      to serve on the United States Supreme Court. \n\nAnd I did that 4 days ago,
      when I nominated Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson. One of
      our nation\u2019s top legal minds, who will continue Justice Breyer\u2019s legacy
      of excellence.\nQuestion: What did the president say about Justice Breyer\nRelevant
      text, if any:", "Use the following portion of a long document to see if any
      of the text is relevant to answer the question. \nReturn any relevant text verbatim.\nA
      former top litigator in private practice. A former federal public defender.
      And from a family of public school educators and police officers. A consensus
      builder. Since she\u2019s been nominated, she\u2019s received a broad range
      of support\u2014from the Fraternal Order of Police to former judges appointed
      by Democrats and Republicans. \n\nAnd if we are to advance liberty and justice,
      we need to secure the Border and fix the immigration system. \n\nWe can do both.
      At our border, we\u2019ve installed new technology like cutting-edge scanners
      to better detect drug smuggling.  \n\nWe\u2019ve set up joint patrols with Mexico
      and Guatemala to catch more human traffickers.  \n\nWe\u2019re putting in place
      dedicated immigration judges so families fleeing persecution and violence can
      have their cases heard faster. \n\nWe\u2019re securing commitments and supporting
      partners in South and Central America to host more refugees and secure their
      own borders.\nQuestion: What did the president say about Justice Breyer\nRelevant
      text, if any:", "Use the following portion of a long document to see if any
      of the text is relevant to answer the question. \nReturn any relevant text verbatim.\nWe\u2019re
      going after the criminals who stole billions in relief money meant for small
      businesses and millions of Americans.  \n\nAnd tonight, I\u2019m announcing
      that the Justice Department will name a chief prosecutor for pandemic fraud.
      \n\nBy the end of this year, the deficit will be down to less than half what
      it was before I took office.  \n\nThe only president ever to cut the deficit
      by more than one trillion dollars in a single year. \n\nLowering your costs
      also means demanding more competition. \n\nI\u2019m a capitalist, but capitalism
      without competition isn\u2019t capitalism. \n\nIt\u2019s exploitation\u2014and
      it drives up prices. \n\nWhen corporations don\u2019t have to compete, their
      profits go up, your prices go up, and small businesses and family farmers and
      ranchers go under. \n\nWe see it happening with ocean carriers moving goods
      in and out of America. \n\nDuring the pandemic, these foreign-owned companies
      raised prices by as much as 1,000% and made record profits.\nQuestion: What
      did the president say about Justice Breyer\nRelevant text, if any:", "Use the
      following portion of a long document to see if any of the text is relevant to
      answer the question. \nReturn any relevant text verbatim.\nAnd for our LGBTQ+
      Americans, let\u2019s finally get the bipartisan Equality Act to my desk. The
      onslaught of state laws targeting transgender Americans and their families is
      wrong. \n\nAs I said last year, especially to our younger transgender Americans,
      I will always have your back as your President, so you can be yourself and reach
      your God-given potential. \n\nWhile it often appears that we never agree, that
      isn\u2019t true. I signed 80 bipartisan bills into law last year. From preventing
      government shutdowns to protecting Asian-Americans from still-too-common hate
      crimes to reforming military justice. \n\nAnd soon, we\u2019ll strengthen the
      Violence Against Women Act that I first wrote three decades ago. It is important
      for us to show the nation that we can come together and do big things. \n\nSo
      tonight I\u2019m offering a Unity Agenda for the Nation. Four big things we
      can do together.  \n\nFirst, beat the opioid epidemic.\nQuestion: What did the

      our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices
      of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \n\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart.
      This year we are finally together again. \n\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans
      and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \n\nWith a duty to one
      another to the American people to the Constitution. \n\nAnd with an unwavering
      resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \n\nSix days ago, Russia\u2019s
      Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he
      could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \n\nHe
      thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he
      met a wall of strength he never imagined. \n\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \n\nFrom
      President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their
      determination, inspires the world. \n\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with
      their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending
      their homeland.\nSource: 0-pl\nContent: And we won\u2019t stop. \n\nWe have
      lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss
      of life. \n\nLet\u2019s use this moment to reset. Let\u2019s stop looking at
      COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful
      disease.  \n\nLet\u2019s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing
      each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \n\nWe can\u2019t change
      how divided we\u2019ve been. But we can change how we move forward\u2014on COVID-19
      and other issues we must face together. \n\nI recently visited the New York
      City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his
      partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \n\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when
      a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \n\nOfficer Mora was 27 years
      old. \n\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \n\nBoth Dominican Americans who\u2019d grown
      up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \n\nI
      spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their
      sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety
      every community deserves.\nSource: 24-pl\nContent: And a proud Ukrainian people,
      who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will
      not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \n\nTo all Americans,
      I will be honest with you, as I\u2019ve always promised. A Russian dictator,
      invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \n\nAnd I\u2019m taking
      robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia\u2019s
      economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses
      and consumers. \n\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked
      with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around
      the world.  \n\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels
      from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary,
      unified with our allies.  \n\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at
      home. And I know the news about what\u2019s happening can seem alarming. \n\nBut
      I want you to know that we are going to be okay.\nSource: 5-pl\nContent: More
      support for patients and families. \n\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund
      ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \n\nIt\u2019s based
      on DARPA\u2014the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS,
      and so much more.  \n\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose\u2014to drive breakthroughs
      in cancer, Alzheimer\u2019s, diabetes, and more. \n\nA unity agenda for the
      nation. \n\nWe can do this. \n\nMy fellow Americans\u2014tonight , we have gathered
      in a sacred space\u2014the citadel of our democracy. \n\nIn this Capitol, generation
      after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife,
      and have done great things. \n\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty,
      defeated totalitarianism and terror. \n\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and
      most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \n\nNow is the hour. \n\nOur
      moment of responsibility. \n\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history
      itself. \n\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is
      found. Our future is forged. \n\nWell I know this nation.\nSource: 34-pl\n=========\nFINAL
